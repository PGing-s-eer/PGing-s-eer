- 👋 Hi, I’m @PGing-s-eer
- It's my first time on GitHub ! (08/2024)
- My GitHub doesn't have any purpose at this moment, but I'd use it to deposit whatever I wanted, maybe to keep a record of my journey as a data lover.  
- 👀 I’m interested in forecasting everything and anything
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Big Data Analytics for Business at Ieseg School on the Lille campus (The best campus 😎)
- 💞️ I’m looking for proffessional oportunities or tips.
- 📫 Contact me by e-mail 📥 pamagaillard@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I discovered Data analytics during an academic exchange in Sweden where i falled in love with predicting setosa, virginica and versicolor 🤓
- Just kidding, there is one thousand other reasons why, but if you want to discover which one, text me 😉
